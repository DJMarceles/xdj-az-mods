/* Bus fd tracking (guest/azmod/bus_interpose.c): open() records the subucom bus
 * descriptors by number and read()/ioctl() decode and edit whatever has that
 * number. run.sh extracts gpiodrv_slot, bus_fd_drop, bus_fd_forget, bus_fd_note
 * and the open/close/dup2/dup3 interposers by text, with "/dev/..." rewritten to
 * FDT_DEV "/..." so the "devices" are plain files in a scratch directory. The
 * interposers really interpose here: this binary's open/close/dup2/dup3 are the
 * extracted ones, forwarding to libc through dlsym(RTLD_NEXT), as in EP147.
 *
 * The question each case asks is the one read() asks before it decodes a mixer
 * frame (fd == g_mixer_fd && fd >= 0) or an ErP frame (fd == g_erp_fd): after the
 * bus fd is gone and its number is reused by another file, the answer must be no.
 * The control is the old code (open-only tracking), plus one hook disabled at a
 * time; each must fail. */
